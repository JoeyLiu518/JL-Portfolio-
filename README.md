# Joey Liu's Portfolio

## My Task and What I Learned
- To create my first portfolio demonstrating skills I've learned surrounding HTML and CSS. 
- Uniquely create a portfolio to build upon in the future as I further my knowledge.
- I believe I have a firm grasp of HTML, whereas in CSS I need some assistance where the Tutor has helped tremendously
- Image allignment is something I still need to understand as well.
- While I do not believe this portfolio is ready for employers to see. I am proud of my understanding of why certain parts of the page act the way they are. I was excited to create the contact button and allow you to move to different parts of the page when clicked on.
- Frustrations caused me to take more time than needed on this project, as the header took about 6 hours. I believe I could have done it in 1 or 2 if I just understood the concepts better before starting this project.
